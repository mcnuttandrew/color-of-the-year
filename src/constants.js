This technique suggests to us that it is significantly more likely for PANTONE to select a color that is predominantly red (specifically it is nearly four times more likely to pick a red color than a blue one). While sunbursts are easily criticized for their relationship to the dreaded pie chart, they are quite effective for compactly describing tree based and part to whole relationships, such as what we see above.';

To get a good view of this, we present the colors in the context of other on going processes that might we might be familiar with. I argue that singular events might be more striking in our memory (who doesn’t remember the day Obama was first elected), but the long term events that we know well, such as whether or not Punxsutawney Phil will see his shadow, are more evocative of everyday life, simply because we live with those moments more often.';
